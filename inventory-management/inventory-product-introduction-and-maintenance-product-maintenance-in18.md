long_description: "This technical document outlines the procedures for using the Product Maintenance (IN18) screen within an inventory control system. The primary purpose of this function is to maintain existing product codes that were previously created using Product Introduction (IN17). The document explains that any changes made to a product code's specification or dimension will retroactively affect all logs using that code. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to access the IN18 screen. The core of the document is a detailed breakdown of every field across several related windows: the main Product Maintenance screen, Specification Details, Product Dimensions, Dimension Tolerances, Active Warehouse, Product Recipe, and various remark entry screens. Each section includes a screenshot of the user interface followed by a table that describes each field and its proper use, including data entry rules, display-only information, and keyboard shortcuts like using `<F4>` to open supplemental windows. It serves as an essential reference for users responsible for managing product data, ensuring accuracy and consistency across the system."
