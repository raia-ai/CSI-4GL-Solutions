long_description: "This document is a technical guide from 4GL Solutions that provides detailed instructions for creating handheld user login sheets within the StayLinked software environment. The purpose is to streamline the login process for users of handheld barcode scanners by allowing them to scan a series of barcodes for their username, password, and other commands instead of manual entry. The guide walks the user through the StayLinked Administrator interface, starting with navigating to the 'Scan2Command Profiles' section. It details how to create a new profile, name it, and select the correct barcode symbology (Code 128). The core of the tutorial focuses on adding individual commands to the profile for the user's name, password, a specific login script, and an exit command. For each command, the guide explains how to define both the command text (the data to be barcoded) and the caption (the human-readable text printed below the barcode). Finally, it shows how to save the completed profile and provides a visual sample of the resulting printed login sheet, which features the scannable barcodes for each step of the login process."
