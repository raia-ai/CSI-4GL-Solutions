It organizes the keypad features by section, covering the physical layout, primary and secondary key functions, and how to invoke special characters or modes using modifier keys such as Blue, Orange, Shift, and Alpha. It explains common operational keys like Enter, Backspace, Space, Escape, Tab, and navigation arrows, and describes how users perform scanning with dedicated trigger keys or pistol grip attachments. Where available, the guide notes LED indicators, backlighting behavior, and practical shortcuts for tasks like toggling the backlight, adjusting volume, or accessing application hotkeys. The content is designed for technicians, operators, and administrators who configure or train users on data capture workflows, ensuring consistent keypad usage across models. Tables and bullet points make it easy to compare functions and reference key combinations during deployment and support."

Title: Handheld Keypad Overview

Description: The purpose of this document is to overview the keys that customers would typically use with the handhelds. This should assist us with offering support by giving us a clearer picture of what the customers are seeing/using. ***NOTE*** Zebra continuously updates the keypad layout so depending on when the device was purchased, the layout might be slightly different. I would do my best to get updated photos and add them to the doc.

- In this HH version, this key is the home button

- Navigation keys are used to move through various entries/lines

- The Escape key can be used to exit a function and go back to the main menu on the HH

- There are certain scenarios where the escape key would not work; in these cases, the HH would beep. To proceed, you might need to use the F3 key first then the escape key

- Backspace key

- The Shift key, in this version, would be used to access the function keys (or similarly coloured keys). For instance, if I would like to F3 out of a screen, I would have to first press the “Shift” key then the “F3” key

- The Enter key is used to enter and confirm entries

- The Function keys work similarly to SM3 with F3, F4, F6 and F7 keys being the ones that are utilized

- F3 – save and exit

- F4 – drill in or open a window

- F6 – select

- F7 – delete

- This button would be pressed if I would like to access the orange options that are on the top right of certain keys. For example, if I would like to enter “W” I would first hit the orange key then the F5 key

- On/off button. If the HH is in sleep mode, a short press would turn on the screen. However, if the HH is completely powered off, a long press (about 5 seconds) would power on the device.
