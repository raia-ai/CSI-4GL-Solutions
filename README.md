# 4GL Knowledge Base

Welcome to the official 4GL Knowledge Base, a comprehensive resource for users of the 4GL ERP platform. This repository is designed to provide clear, accessible, and detailed documentation for all modules and functionalities within the system. Whether you are a new user seeking foundational knowledge or an experienced administrator looking for specific procedural guidance, this knowledge base serves as the single source of truth for all 4GL-related information. The content is meticulously organized by functional area to help you quickly find the answers you need to optimize your workflows and master the full capabilities of the platform.

This knowledge base is structured into several key categories, each representing a core component of the 4GL ecosystem. The **Accounting** section provides in-depth guides on managing Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable, while **Inventory Management** covers everything from product introduction to physical counts and scrap policies. For sales-focused teams, the **Sales & Order Entry** and **Purchasing** sections detail the complete lifecycle of customer orders and procurement processes. Operational workflows are documented in the **Logistics & Shipping** and **Production** categories, which explain manifest procedures and in-house production scheduling. Furthermore, dedicated sections for **Hardware & Devices**, **Reports & Analytics**, and a **Metals Industry Reference** provide specialized information on configuring physical equipment, generating system reports, and understanding key industry concepts. Finally, the **System Help** category contains an extensive library of detailed help topics for every function and screen within 4GL.

To make the most of this resource, we recommend starting with the **Overview & Getting Started** section, which includes valuable training guides and a quick reference for external resources. From there, you can navigate to the specific module or topic of interest using the hierarchical table of contents. Each document includes a quick reference table with key metadata, such as the original source file, version, and a brief description, allowing you to assess its relevance at a glance. This knowledge base is a living resource, continuously updated to reflect the latest system enhancements and best practices. It is structured for both human readability and efficient searching by AI-powered support agents, ensuring you can find precise information through either manual navigation or semantic query.
