# 4GL Solutions: TECHNOLOGY FOR THE METAL INDUSTRY

## ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

### Introduction
The accounts receivable module in STEEL MANAGER III gives the user the ability to offer their customers credit facilities, and at the same time place a tight control on delinquent accounts. It also highlights all outstanding documents and ensures a timely collection of these, and at the same time, minimizes the exposure to bad debts. The accounts receivable module in STEEL MANAGER III will bring your average days to pay down to an acceptable level. With the help of built in credit checks, your bad debt exposure will be minimized.

### Highlights
Your collections process will be made easier with the help of our comprehensive document application and tools, such as:

- **System Credit controls on new orders.** If an order fails credit, the Credit Manager will automatically receive a Task advising them of the order on Credit Hold. All the credit information will be instantly viewable by the Credit Manager. Once the manager has made a decision to either approve or disapprove the order, the sales person will automatically receive a Task advising them.
- **Inquiries into a customer's credit history,** the status of any open orders, invoices and receipts. Immediate on-line viewing of ageing buckets.
- **Delivery of Invoices and Statements via Email/Fax** (at time of shipment) is available directly from STEEL MANAGER III.
- **AR inquiry by aging** allowing the credit department to concentrate on problem accounts.
- **Ability to enter notes** on Transactions and/or Customer during Collection process.
- **Interest charged** on Past due accounts.
- **Ability to drill down to source document level**.
- **Full integration with other modules** improving the accuracy and timing of information.

### New Accounts
New accounts will be faxed or emailed a credit application form and “new customer package" straight from SM3. Once completed and returned, these documents can be electronically attached to the customer profile for safe storage and easy retrieval.

**Figure 10.1: Customer File Maintenance**
*(This figure shows the user interface for maintaining customer master data, including name, address, credit terms, and contact information.)*

### Tracks All Changes to AR & AP
- All changes to fields in Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable will be tracked as to who made the change, when it was made with the old and new values.

**Figure: Account Changes Tracking Screen**
*(This figure displays a log of changes made to a customer account, showing the field name (e.g., CREDIT LINE), the old value, and the new value, along with the user, date, and time of the change.)*

### Credit Check
Once a sales order is created it is then passed through a credit check. SM3 Credit Checks include:
- Is the Customer over the Credit Limit?
- Are there any past Due Transactions over XX days?
- Has there been no activity for XX days?
- or whether the customer has been placed on manual Credit Hold?

If any one of the checks fails, Sales Order will be “held” and will be transferred to the credit department via Task Manager.

**Figure: SM3 Task Manager**
*(This figure shows the Task Manager screen, which lists orders requiring credit approval with details such as document number, account, status, and reason for the hold.)*

The credit department can then do an inquiry into the customer's credit. This is a very informative screen, and will give the user plenty of information with which to contact the customer and negotiate the release of the current and any future orders. Information that is available for the user is as follows: start date, credit line, last sale date and amount, average days to pay, highest credit date and amount, last payment date and amount, sales history, open AR and orders.

**Figure: Customer AR Inquiry**
*(This figure displays a comprehensive A/R inquiry screen for a single customer, showing credit limits, balances, aging details, and a list of all open documents like invoices and credit memos.)*

Notes can be entered against an invoice for follow-up purposes.

### Credit Notes
Credit notes can be issued to customers for a variety of reasons. These include over invoice, price adjustment and inventory returns. Each reason (specified in the credit note), can be associated with a specific GL code which is useful for return analysis. If credit notes make reference to an invoice, the system will check to see that the credit value does not exceed the original invoice amount. Once a credit has been entered it is put into a "hold" status and a "credit authorization" form is printed. Credit/Debit Notes can have additional authorizations – the Task Manager informs the Approval authorities of open documents awaiting approval. Once material is returned, any inventory will be returned and the credit amount will be posted to Accounts Receivable. When returning inventory, it is possible to revalue the inventory based on its salability.

### Payments
Payments can be received by check, post-dated check, electronic funds transfer, credit card and cash. Miscellaneous checks can also be entered for non-accounts receivable accounts. During the entry process it will be possible to apply amounts to specific outstanding documents or to post it "on account" if the document is not specified at the time. Once all entries have been entered and balanced, they can then be processed into the AR file. A deposit slip report can be printed as a back-up.

**Figure 10.3: Cash Receipt Entry**
*(This figure shows the screen for entering cash receipts, listing multiple checks received from a customer that make up a single deposit.)*

### Unapplied Documents
A helpful tool available in the AR system is the “unapplied documents" maintenance screen. Here any un-applied documents are displayed and can be easily linked to any other documents if they are known. This generally keeps the aging in a "clean" state.

## ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

### Introduction
The Accounts Payable module will track vendor invoices and payments. It will also track accruals where material has been received, but no vendor invoice has been linked to it yet. This will allow companies to have an accurate analysis of monies owed, and will prevent overpayment or duplicate payment of vendor invoices.

### Highlights
The Accounts Payable module is where you perform functions related to Vendors (adding and maintaining), tracking Vendor invoices and issuing Checks for payment and/or Electronic Payments (no check issued). You can enter and process invoices and disbursements, reconcile checks, perform Accounts Payable period ends, maintain Vendor master files, and administrate the Accounts Payable process. The Accounts Payable module also provides the ability to track accruals – Inventory items have been received, awaiting receipt (link) to Vendor invoice.

The Accounts Payable module helps you organize your cash flow efficiently and accurately. With the ability to break down the landed cost and the automatic accrual mechanism, you're able to accurately validate vendor invoices and track any purchase variances.

- **Break Down and analyze all components of landed cost**
- **Comprehensive Vendor File** contains pertinent information central to payables & purchasing
- Using our disbursement module together with our cash forecasting, you will always **cut the right checks at the right time.**
- **Inventory Receipts** are matched to Vendor invoices comparing actual to estimated costs for all components of landed cost
- **Accrual accounting:** Receipts are accrued at the time of receipt to assist in matching expenses with revenues in the same accounting period
- **Option to distribute variances from material and outside processing invoices.** SM3 will automatically create a cost adjustment for in stock material or if sold will adjust the cost of sales on the invoice
- **Reports and inquiries** keep track of payments due, vendor analysis, and cash requirements and aging
- **EFT/ACH Payments**
- **Automatically create “Positive Pay” file** to send to bank

### Accruals
When inventory is received, the system will automatically create an accrual entry. The inventory account will be debited and accrual account credited. Each cost component of the landed cost will be accrued separately so they can be referenced individually from the vendor invoicing function.

The following schematic communicates how Steel Manager III handles accruals. Your accountant can close Month-Ends without having to wait for Invoices from the supplier (including Freight/Brokerage, etc.)

### How SM3 handles Accruals in General Ledger

**1. At time of Purchase Order / Outside Processing Posting of Receipts**
(Assume a Receipt Landed cost of $1000)

| Inventory | | Accruals | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dr** | **Cr** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| 1,000.00 | | | 1,000.00 |

**2. At time of entering/posting AP Voucher (screen AP21B)**
(Assume Vendor Invoice is $10 higher than PO Price - total Invoice Amount $1,010.00)

| Accruals | | A/P | | Price Variance | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dr** | **Cr** | **Dr** | **Cr** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| 1,000.00 | | | 1,010.00 | 10.00 | |

**3. Payment of Invoice**

| A/P | | Bank | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dr** | **Cr** | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| 1,010.00 | | | 1,010.00 |

**Options**
**2b. If SM3 is set to automatically distribute Variances to Inventory or Cost of Goods Sold**

| Variance | | Inventory* | | OR | COGS* | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dr** | **Cr** | **Dr** | **Cr** | | **Dr** | **Cr** |
| | 10.00 | 10.00 | 0.00 | | 10.00 | 0.00 |

*(partial if stock not 100% sold)*
***No taxes are taken into consideration with above examples**

### Vendor Invoices
Vendor invoices are entered into the system when they are received. The system will perform a check on the invoice number to ensure that no duplicates are entered. The GL debit account(s) to be affected will default from the vendor type which would have been previously assigned to the vendor.

**Figure: Accounts Payable Vendor Payables Inquiry**
*(This figure shows an inquiry screen listing all vouchers for a specific vendor, with details like invoice number, date, currency, open balance, and paid amount.)*

Drilling down into any of the Voucher numbers will provide details of the vendor invoice as follows.

**Figure: Vendor Invoice Details**
*(This figure shows the detail of a single vendor invoice, breaking down the total amount into its GL components, such as Accruals and taxes.)*

If the vendor is an inventory vendor, one of the default accounts will be the accrual account. In such cases, the software will force the entry operator to find and select the appropriate accrual record that was previously generated by the receiving module. This accrual may easily be found through a number of different searches methods. Once the accrual record has been selected, the receipt details will be displayed allowing the operator to check the receipt values against the vendor invoice values. If there is a difference that exceeds the acceptable variance percent, the operator will be issued with a warning.

**Figure 11.1: Vendor Invoice Ref. To Receipt Details**
*(This figure displays a comparison screen between the original receipt details (quantity, price) and the billed details from the vendor invoice, highlighting any variance.)*

STEEL MANAGER III also caters for non-inventory purchases orders and payments.

Vendor invoices can be reversed from the system. By doing this, opposite entries to the original invoice will be posted and the accrual will be reinstated.

### Payments
Payments can be processed in a few different ways.
1. The invoices can be selected from an open payable list in which case they will be added to a batch for check writing.
2. Direct disbursements can be utilized, which gives the ability to process a check (“quick Check”) directly from the system crediting a bank account and debiting an expense/accrual account(s).
3. Check batch processing. This can be achieved by entering select parameters into a screen. If the parameters are met, the invoice will be selected for payment. Some of the select parameters are: vendor type and payment terms.
4. **Steel Manager III** also provides the ability to create payments to be processed by EFT (electronic funds transfer) or ACH payments. EFT batches can be created in the same manner as check batches which are outlined in the previous points.

Checks may easily be voided by selecting the original check number. By voiding a check, the entries generated from the original check will be reversed with a separate entry.

Payments and void checks will create an entry into the integrated cash book (Bank Reconciliation). Please see the General Ledger documentation for a more detailed discussion of the cash book functionality.

A separate function can be used to track which checks have been mailed.

### Reports and Inquiries
There are a number of different inquiry screens available to the user. The vendor payables inquiry allows users to see the current accounts payable status of a particular vendor on the screen. This screen will show outstanding invoices as well as invoices that have already been paid. In the case of previously paid invoices, the system displays the check number with which the selected invoice(s) were paid.

The accrual inquiry screen displays receipts that have not had a vendor invoice associated with them, as well as receipts that have already been linked to an invoice. The system provides the ability to drill down into the estimated field in order to show the breakdown of the accrual (base price, freight, insurance, etc.). By drilling down on the actual column the operator has the ability to view the details of the vendor invoices. Finally, the write off field displays General Ledger journal entries that have affected the selected accrual record.

**Figure 11.2: Purchase Variance Inquiry**
*(This figure shows a report that lists purchase orders and their associated receipts, comparing the estimated cost with the actual invoiced cost to calculate and display any variance.)*

## GENERAL LEDGER

### Introduction
The General Ledger is the final repository for all transactions in STEEL MANAGER III. Through the GL the operator will be able to see an overview of the company and current financial status. Access to GL modules can only be obtained by an operator who has been granted the necessary security level.

### Highlights
General Ledger integration will **simplify your company's entire accounting procedure.** Automation removes the margin of error associated with manual entries. Access to GL modules can only be obtained by an operator who has been granted the necessary security level.

**Features include:**
- Integrated cash book (Bank Reconciliation)
- Report writer
- Ability to drill down to the document level
- Financial Report Generator allows the creation of custom financial reports
- Sales and Cost of Sales can be reported by product line
- Multi-currency capability
- Option to save non-financial data within a GL account, i.e. headcount against salary GL account, pounds sold against sales account

### File Maintenance
The Chart of Accounts can be imported into Steel Manager III via Excel spreadsheets. Steel Manager III can handle a variety of formats for its account codes, but the recommended format would be xxxx-yy where xxxx represents the account code and yy would represent a warehouse code (if there were multiple warehouses). By having the last two characters as the warehouse code, it is possible to track financial transactions by warehouse. On each account, the operator can indicate whether the account should be consolidated (warehouse code to be 00) or not consolidated, in which case the warehouse ID will represent the last two characters of the GL code).

Steel Manager III allows input of budget numbers into the GL. These numbers will be entered against the chart of accounts and will later be used by the financial report generator to conduct budget vs. actual comparisons.

### Transaction Processing
Standard Journal Entries can be entered into the system. Through the journal entry screen entries are allowed into accounts such as Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and Accruals. When accounts such as these are used, there is an option to affect the sub-ledgers directly. For example, if Accounts Receivable is affected, the journal can be applied to a customer invoice.

Recurring journals can also be entered. In this case, a frequency and occurrence can be entered. The frequency will define whether the journal will be every month, two months, etc. The occurrence will define how many journal entries will actually be created. For example, if a recurring journal with a frequency of 2 and an occurrence of 3 is entered, the system will create 3 journal entries – one every 2 months. This is useful for fixed expenses where the value of the journal does not fluctuate.

### Cash Book
Steel Manager III has an integrated Cash Book and bank reconciliation. Every time the bank(s) are affected in the system, an entry will be created in the cash book. This will occur when writing a check, voiding a check, receiving cash, reversing a cash receipt, or if a journal entry affects the bank. Although these entries are automatic, the operator may optionally make entries directly into the cash book. This direct entry is often used for bank charges and other entries of this nature.

The bank reconciliation will allow comparison and reconciliation of the bank statement with the entries in the cash book by checking off entries. At the end of the process, the closing balance on the bank statement should match the balance in the cash book. The reconciliation will show checks that have not yet cleared the bank as well as other entries that have not yet affected the bank account.

### Inquiries
The General Ledger detailed inquiry screen will allow the operator to view the activity of any specified account. This inquiry screen will allow for to drill down to a summary level (daily entry), a detailed level (document level), and will actually allow drill down into the document itself. For example, an operator could drill down into the inventory account and see that there was a credit of $15,000 for a particular date. If he/she drills down further, the invoices that make up the $15,000 can be seen. The operator could then drill down into the invoice to see the line items that are on the invoice.

### Standard Reports
STEEL MANAGER III comes equipped with a number of standard reports.

The trial balance report will allow the operator to specify which fiscal period the report is for. It will also give an option to specify this period only. Furthermore, there is an option of specifying a range of accounts (to filter the report as desired).

A rolling TB can be extracted directly into Excel. This is an extremely powerful, time saving feature that will allow easy analysis of quarterly, bi-annual, and annual numbers.

**Figure 12.1: Sample Excel Spreadsheet**
*(This figure shows an example of a rolling trial balance exported to Excel, with GL accounts listed in rows and monthly balances in columns.)*

For auditing and balancing purposes, **Steel Manager III** comes with a standard detailed GL report. This report can be filtered by date, source of transaction, account, account range, and posted/non-posted entries. The user will find this an invaluable tool when checking and balancing account details.

Another very useful report built into the software is the cash forecasting report. This report will allow the operator to forecast cash flow based on historical financial information. For example, the receivables are analyzed on the average days to pay of a particular customer and the payables are analyzed based on the average time it takes to pay a vendor. Fixed expenses that do not go through the receivables or payables can be entered into the system so that they are also considered in the forecast report.

### Period Ends
Steel Manager III will allow the user to close periods to prevent unwanted transactions from hitting the GL. Please note that once a period has been closed, customers will still be able to affect the period through one or more GL journal entries. Generally, this feature would be used by controllers to post closing entries. It also includes a year-end function that will generate a year-end report, clear out all of the P&L accounts and post the difference to retained earnings. Furthermore, it will cycle your dates file so that you have a new-year open for transactions.

### Report Writer
Over and above the standard reports, Steel Manager III is equipped with a parameter driven report writer which will allow customers to customize their financial statements (balance sheet and income statement). The module will allow grouping of accounts, creation of headings, sub-totals, totals, and implementation of other useful features.
