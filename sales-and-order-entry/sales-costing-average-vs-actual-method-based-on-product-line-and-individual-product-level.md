# Costing Method Based on Product Line and Individual Product Level

**Description:** Actual vs Average Costing setup for products and product lines.

Let me break this down in two parts to help clarify how costing methods are handled in the system:

## 1. Product Line Level

You can check the default costing method set for a product line by following these steps:

-   Navigate to **IN16**
-   Select the product line (e.g., **ASH**)
-   Click on **More Options** to open the *Product Line Options* window
-   Under **Costing Method**, you'll see whether the default is set to **Average** or **Actual**

This default setting determines how costing is applied when new products are created under that product line. However, please note that the actual costing method used is controlled at the **product level**.

For the ASH product line, the default is set to **Average Costing**.

### Screenshot: IN16 Product Line Options

The screenshot below shows the `Product Line Options` window in the `SM3 Product Line` screen (`IN16`), where the **Costing Method** is set to `Average` for the `ASH` product line.
