Generating a Report
===================

Reports allow you to generate a document containing organized information specific to desired fields. Each module’s menu includes a submenu holding its reports. Data is never deleted, so you can reprint historical information, e.g. an invoice or look-up an MTR from 10 years ago.

1. Navigate to the required report, either via the appropriate menu path or you can enter the report’s screen code to jump directly to the report.
2. Select the report parameters: Each report allows you to specify the parameters you want to include in the report. Some require Yes or No entries, denoted by “Y” or entering a blank into the prompt. Other fields provide an ellipsis that allow you to select the parameter. Date ranges do not have to be within the same fiscal year.
3. In the Printer field, identify how or where you want the report to be output. This can be a particular printer, or a report may provide the option to output to an Excel spreadsheet (XLS) or PDF file (according to symbols displayed), or you can choose to just view the output on your screen (enter “LPS”).

To print the report, enter the printer code (or XLS or PDF or LPS) directly.

If you want to view the list of printers, or control the number of copies or tray, or to fax or email the report, click the ellipsis to view and specify output options. [info re fax/email here or link to Sending Documents by Fax or Email]

4. When you are ready to generate the report, enter “**Y**” in the OK? field.
