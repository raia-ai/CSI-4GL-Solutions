Highlights
==========

Linking of OP/IP Documents When Created From an SO
--------------------------------------------------

When there is one or more machine lines on a sales order defined as an Outside process as well as machines lines defined as Inside process, the resulting OP and IP documents are linked: the Committments tab for the FG in the OP shows that it has been allocated to the new IP, and the Committed In tab for the RM in the IP shows that it is linked to the new OP. Once both are processed, the sales order will print. 38370

View Other Open Orders in a Sales Order
---------------------------------------

When entering an order, you can see a count of open orders for the same customer and ship-to as the current order and view a list of these orders. In this list you can inquire on an order or print the order lines with the same required date as the current order to Excel. 38222

Receipt Confirmation Task Created from PO41
-------------------------------------------

If a sales order has the same product reserved as the received product on the PO, a Receipt Confirmation task is sent to the salesperson. 38058

AutoFill Line Numbers in Resequence Window
------------------------------------------

In the Resequence window, the Same button has been replaced with an AutoFill button. Enter the new line number for one or more lines, then click AutoFill to populate the remaining lines in sequence. For example, if there are four lines and you change line 4 to “2” and click AutoFill, the lines will be renumbered as 1,3,4,2. 38249

-------------------------------

The Details tab of a sales order now includes a Picked Qty column that displays the picked quantity in selling units. 38335
