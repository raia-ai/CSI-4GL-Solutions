About Inventory Control
=======================

The Inventory module is designed to record and track all movements affecting the Inventory file, ensuring an accurate and up-to-date available balance for each product code. Accurate tracking of inventory, including remnants (drops), is a key component to succeeding in the fast-paced, highly competitive, distribution business.

The Inventory Control module is where you perform functions related to product specifications (including dimensions/shapes, weights, chemistry) product lines, product maintenance, product recipes, product suggested selling prices and tiers, inventory classifications, inventory adjustments, branch transfers and physical inventory. You can enter and maintain product specifications, product lines and products, suggested selling prices and tiers, branch transfers and inventory adjustments.
