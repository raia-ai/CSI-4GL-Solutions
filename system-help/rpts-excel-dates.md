Fixing the Date Format in Excel Reports
=======================================

Excel will use your system default date when opening  Excel reports. To have the date fields recognized as date fields instead of text you will need to change the Regional settings in Windows.

1. Open the Control Panel and open the Region settings.
2. Click Additional settings.
3. Change the Short date format to MM/dd/yyyy.

Excel will now recognize the dates as date fields and not text on all newly run reports.
