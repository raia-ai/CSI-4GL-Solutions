About the Dashboards
====================

4gltest / stm4gl

The Dashboard Reporting module provides a graphical representation of important metrics in an easy- to-read format. Drill-down features enable a detailed analysis of different aspects of your business in real-time.

Dashboard reports are mobile-friendly, so before calling on an account, sales staff can connect to the internet with a device such as an iPad or mobile phone and access real-time information about the account, such as Open Quotes, Open Orders, Sales by Product Line, Call Report information, etc.

More dashboards, e.g. for Finance, are in development. The screenshots below are examples and may not represent the current state.

currently provides the following dashboards:

* The **Salesperson** dashboard allows sales staff to view Daily sales, Open Orders, Open Quotes, Invoices and more to see how they are doing.

* The **Customer** dashboard is linked to the Salesperson dashboard: if you access it directly, you are prompted to select the customer, then in the dashboard you can click the Home button to go to the Salesperson dashboard. Conversely, you can click a customer from the Salesperson dashboard to open the dashboard for that customer.  
  The initial Main view of the Customer dashboard presents a high-level summary of how the account is performing:

  Additional tabs display details of Open Quotes, Orders & Invoices, as well as any Remarks on the account and Contact information:

* The **Production** dashboard displays production statistics by process or by machine, including Open Orders and Sales, for all or select warehouses.

* The **Sales Manager** dashboard displays the same types of information as the Salesperson dashboard, but aggregated for all sales people. It includes an additional widget to view the leading sales people (inside or outside) and their sales, profit, and profit % either MTD or YTD.
* The **Outside Salesperson** dashboard works the same as the Salesperson dashboard except all sales (orders and invoices) are filtered on the outside salesperson on the document.
* The **Sales Territory** dashboard is the same as the Sales Manager dashboard except it filters on territories instead of salesperson.

Within each dashboard are multiple “widgets” that present different types of data. Click on a widget to drill-down to more details. These are outlined in the following topics:
