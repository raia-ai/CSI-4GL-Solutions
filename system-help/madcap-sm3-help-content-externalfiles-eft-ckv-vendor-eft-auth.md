short_description: "Template for Vendor EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) Authorization used by Our Steel Company. Includes introductory letter, privacy statement, vendor update information, and financial institution details with fields for routing, account number, and contact information to enable electronic payments."
long_description: "This document is a structured help-content template for initiating vendor electronic payments (EFT) with Our Steel Company. It opens with a brief letter explaining the convenience of receiving invoice payments electronically and invites vendors to enroll. A Privacy Statement section outlines the company’s Privacy Policy, emphasizing the importance of confidentiality and describing: the information collected, how that information is used or shared to complete transactions, and the elements of a vendor’s client profile. It clarifies that information is not shared with third parties except as required to process payments or comply with legal requests, and that verification steps (such as checks with credit bureaus, banks, or other parties) may be taken to confirm provided details. The core of the file is the Vendor Payment Authorization form. Section 1 captures Vendor Update Information, including vendor name, address, city, state, ZIP code, primary contact, telephone, fax, and a designated email address to receive payment advice notifications. Section 2 captures Financial Institution Information necessary for EFT setup, such as the Routing Transit/ABA number (9 digits), Account number (up to 12 digits), account type, account name, bank name and address, city, state, ZIP code, and bank telephone number. The form concludes with an authorization statement allowing Our Steel Company to deposit funds into the specified account, followed by signature fields for vendor name, authorized signature, printed name, title, and date. This Markdown conversion preserves the original content, formats key sections as headers, and represents digit entry boxes for routing and account numbers using GitHub Flavored Markdown tables for clarity in a text-based repository."
