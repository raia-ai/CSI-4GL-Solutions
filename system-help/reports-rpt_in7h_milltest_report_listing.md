IN7H - Mill Tests
=================

This function produces mill test reports. Each MTR image and list logs associated with that MTR are printed as separate reports.

1. Choose Inventory Control » Inventory Reports » Custom Reports » Mill Tests [IN7H].
3. Enter or select From Log and To Log numbers (by default, From Log = all logs and To Log = last log number assigned, unless From Log = “ALL” in which case To Log is skipped).
