Document Status
===============

This updates the status of the document, e.g. in Order Inquiry, and a status entry is added to the Document Tracking.

If you scan a branch transfer packing slip, the status is attached to both the branch invoice (BI) in the sending warehouse, as well as the BT document in the sending warehouse.

Enter the Document number, then F4 on the Status field and select a status.
