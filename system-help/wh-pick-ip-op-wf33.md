IP/OP Picking Confirmation
==========================

This function is used to confirm raw material logs going out for both OP and IP documents. [WF34 is used to confirm the Actual amount ‘received back’ from the IP production document.]

![](../Resources/Images/WH_pick_OP.png)

Scan or enter (or press F4 to select) the sales order/branch transfer Doc number (if entering manually, you can omit the letter or leading zeroes).

[then what?]

When picking IP documents, upon finalizing the document, 'shop work' and 'production order' forms will print.
