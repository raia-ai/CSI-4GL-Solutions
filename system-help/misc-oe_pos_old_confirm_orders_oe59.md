Assigning Logs to POS Invoices
==============================

OLD PROCESS, UNPUBLISHED, KEPT IN PROJECT FOR POSTERITY (FOR NOW)

At the end of each shift, the POS invoices must be confirmed, assigning the logs to the invoice. This procedure can be done throughout the day.

Choose Sales Order Entry » Point of Sale » POS Confirmation [OE59].

Confirming a POS order works the same as confirming a regular order with the exception that handhelds currently cannot be used to assign the log to the POS order.

When all logs have been selected for the POS order, click Process.

As orders are confirmed (logs have been assigned to the POS order) they will be removed from this window.

[re Auto Confirm All POS Orders [OE9ZL] - does this eliminate the need to go into OE59? - yes per JK, but it may not work; hold off on this - the POS system is being overhauled in 3.13]
