About Quotes and Sales Orders
=============================

[create a new flowchart with descriptions and links to relevant topics]

Quotations
----------

Quotations are optional in the sales order process, but may be required for some of your customers.

* Quotes include a follow-up date (e.g. three days after the date of the quote) and an expiry date (e.g. ten days after the quote date). These dates are configurable and may be overwritten for a quote. Once a quote has expired, it is no longer included in the quote entry/maintenance list unless you specifically request to include expired quotes.
* The Quote(s) Follow Up screen displays all open quotes that have a follow-up date within the range requested, even if they have expired. Here you can add remarks to a quote, view the quote details or, if you know that the customer has declined the quote, mark it as lost, which will remove it from the list. A lost quote can be reopened.
* A quote can be converted to a sales order upon customer approval. The quote contains the same information as a sales order, so you do not need to re-enter order information. A sales order has additional fields to record a customer’s PO number and a specific invoice date.

Sales Orders
------------

There are three options to process a sales order:

* Process a sales order which will create a pick slip and will be picked by handheld devices creating a packing slip.
* Process a sales order selecting the “One Step Invoicing” option (select “O” instead of “P” when processing the sales order).  will immediately take you to the Picking Confirmation screen to pick a log for the order. A packing slip will then be created.
* Create a Point of Sales order.
