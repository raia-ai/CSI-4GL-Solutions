Linking a Sales Order to Another Document
=========================================

You may want to link the sales order to a branch transfer, customer consignment, purchase order, in-house production order, or outsiden processing order. For example, if you link to a purchase order, all line items on the purchase order will be added to the sales order.

1. Choose Sales Order Entry » SO Entry/Maintenance » Sales Order Entry/Maintenance [OE31].
2. Click Link.
3. Select the type of document that you are linking to.

[need more info about purpose/ramifications]

[can also link an OP doc to another doc like a PO - can this “linking” be considered generic enough to be documented in a single topic?]
