Adding a Log Number to the Count File
=====================================

The initiated count file is a snapshot of the log inventory, and it ignores any with zero quantity. If during the count you find some stock of a log that was excluded, you can add the log number. Then you will be able to select the log to record the quantity as part of your regular count updates.

1. Choose Inventory Control » Physical Inventory » Add/Update Log To Count [IN5D].

4. Enter or select the Lognumber.
5. Optionally, view the Movements (history) of this log.
6. Select OK and press Enter to add the log to the count file. You are returned to a blank Lognumber field to add another log. If you are finished, click Exit.

This function is also available on the wireless handheld devices, WF1Y.
