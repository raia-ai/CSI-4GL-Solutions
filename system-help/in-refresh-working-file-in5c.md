Refreshing Work File
====================

This function is used to refresh the physical inventory count work file. All committed inventory must be uncommitted. If you uncommit any inventory, you must execute this function before proceeding.

1. Choose Inventory Control » Physical Inventory » Refresh Working File [IN5C].

4. If you are not counting all product lines at this time, select one or more Product Lines to be counted.
5. Specify whether to Print Reports. The reports are identical to those created when the count was initiated in IN5B, with an additional header “Refresh Working File”.
