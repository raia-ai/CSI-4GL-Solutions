MTR Indexing (placeholder topics)
=================================

[none of the Purchasing>PO Receipts>MTR Indexing functions (PO45, PO46, PO49) have been documented. These are from two 3.11 release notes, capturing it here for if/when these are documented]

PO46 ADD LOG, HEAT AND CASE FILTERS   
Go to PO46. There should be new filters for log number, heat number, and case number. Use these filters for the paging screen.   
If the log number field is not blank, then the paging screen should return all logs that end with the given string of number/letters. e.g. “189” should return all log numbers that end with “189”.  
If the heat number field is not blank, then the paging screen should return all logs with a heat number that contains the given string of number/letters.  
If the case number field is not blank, then the paging screen should return all logs with a case number that contains the given string of number/letters.
