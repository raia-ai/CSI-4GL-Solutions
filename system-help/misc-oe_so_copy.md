Copying a Sales Order
=====================

[can this topic be renamed to apply to quotes as well?]

Create a new sales order based on a previous order by the same customer.

1. Choose Sales Order Entry » SO Entry/Maintenance » Sales Order Entry/Maintenance [OE31].
2. Click Copy.
3. You can search by Customer, PO Number, or Order Desc.
4. All of the order lines from the original order are displayed; click the Sel? check box for each line that you want to copy to a new order, or click Select All.
5. Click Save.

A new sales order is created with a new Document #. It includes the same information - materials ordered, remark lines, pricing breakdowns, etc. Make any changes to the new order as required.[anything else to note about what is/is not copied over?]
