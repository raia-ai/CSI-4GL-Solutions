Inventory Maintenance
=====================

Results Inventory Adjustments
-----------------------------

When the storage/retrieval results are matched against the uploaded documents there is occasionally a difference between the two, which are captured in Adjustment Records. This function allows you to process these adjustments.

1. Choose Toyota ASRS System » Results Inventory Adjustments [TSM53].
2. Change the Process Date if required.
3. Select Show Closed if you want to see previous closed adjustments.
4. The Log Number defaults to “ALL”; specify a log number if you want to see details for that log only.
5. The table displays all adjustments with the following information: Warehouse and Date of adjustment, the Document/Index Number of the transaction that generated the adjustment, [S]end/[R]etrieve Indicator, Product Description, Quantity difference (+/-}, IUM, [C]ompletion flag. You can drill down in the Quantity field to see why the adjustment was generated, with both  and Toyota data side-by-side for ease of comparing.
6. If you agree with an adjustment, select the check box at the end of the adjustment line.
7. If you selected any items, click Process. The Process Options screen displays the number of items and allows you to process the adjustments or put them on hold for later processing.
8. If you processed any adjustments,  will generate an Inventory Adjustment and display the Adjustment Number for authorization.

Stock Data Synchronize
----------------------

To keep the inventory in sync between both systems ( and Toyota), this procedure should be executed daily. It is initiated first by loading all logs from SM3 into a sync file, and then downloading the logs from the Toyota system and matching them.

1. Choose Toyota ASRS System » Stock Data Synchronize (F05) [TSM37].
2. Change the Process Date if required.
3. Select the OK check box, then click Process.

All  logs for selected product lines will be loaded into the sync file. A background process checks for matching data generated by the Toyota system. If it detects any data, it will download all the Toyota logs and match them to the sync file. Matches can be viewed and processed in TSM57.

Stock Data Inquiry
------------------

This function allows you to view the Toyota Log Data downloaded from F05\_DAT.

1. Choose Toyota ASRS System » Stock Data Inquiry [TSM65].
2. Change the Process Date if required.
3. The Status defaults to **O**pen (this will list items that have been downloaded from the Toyota system but not yet processed by ). Optionally change the Status to **D**ownloaded to list items that have been downloaded from Toyota and processed by , or **A**ll to display both Open and Downloaded items.

The following fields will be displayed: Date Key and Sequence No, the logged Date and Time, File Identification, Status, Part Number and Description, Log No, Heat No, Cage No, Stock Quantity, Lane, Bay and Level, Storage and Pick Times.

Synchronize Inventory Adjustments
---------------------------------

Once both the  and Toyota log data has been matched, you can view the results and process any adjustments.

1. Choose Toyota ASRS System » Synchronize Inventory Adjustments [TSM57].
2. Select a Product Line or leave the default “ALL”.
3. If you only want to show items where there is a Quantity Variance, select the Variance check box.
4. Enter the Match Count as follows: “1” = log only in ; “2” = log only in Toyota, “3” = log in both systems.
5. To display previously closed items, select the Show Closed check box.
6. The table displays all adjustments with the following information: Part No, Log Number, Part Description, SM3 On Hand, Toyota On Hand, Match Count, Lane, Bay and Level, Completion Code. Click the Expand button to view additional fields: Storage Date and Time, Final Storage Date and Time, Final Pick Date and Time.
