Copying Lines from Another Quote or Order
=========================================

While on the Details tab for a quote or sales order, you can copy one or more detail lines (including cost/surcharge lines and remarks) from another quote or order. The quote/order you copy from must be in the same currency as the quote/order you are copying into.

1. Click Lines.
2. Indicate the Type of Entry (quote or order) that you want to copy from.
3. When you select the quote/order, all of its detail lines are shown, including cost/surcharge lines.
4. To select individual lines to copy into your new quote/order, select the Sel? check box beside the line. Alternatively, select Select All.
5. Click Save.
