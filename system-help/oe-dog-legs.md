Defining and Viewing Dog Legs
=============================

Creating Dog Legs
-----------------

When you have split logs or adjustments to sheet/plate products [xref to/from receiving IP],  will ask if you want to define “Define Legs” (default is “No").

If you choose “Yes”, you must break down the doglegs into measurable squares/rectangles and provide the dimensions for each of the shapes.

In the following example, we will create a dog leg for the following shape. You also have an opportunity to assign a picture (it can be any file type) to the log, defining the shape.

In , we will enter one piece of the larger rectangle, and two pieces of the smaller rectangles.  will calculate the weight for each defined shape, based on the theoretical weight assigned to the product code.

Viewing Dog Legs
----------------

In the Inventory Inquiry [IN62], SM3 will display the “dogleg” icon in the Type field. When you select a dog leg Log, a Legs button appears at the bottom of the screen that allows you to view the dimensions of the drops (same as shown above).
