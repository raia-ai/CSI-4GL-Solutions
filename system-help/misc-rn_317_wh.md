| 38108 | Enter random lengths before log transfer | When picking random length logs on the handheld with the log transfer switch turned on, you are now prompted to enter the random lengths before the transfer in order to transfer the quantity calculated by the R/L window. | WF11 |  |
| 38161 | Miscellaneous document created in manifest from transfer | New handheld screen allows user to scan a branch transfer delivery note to generate a miscellaneous document in a manifest document. This will be used when transfer material is “passing through” another warehouse and therefore still needs to be planned on a manifest run. Document tracking added for the BTs and sales orders reserved against the incoming BT. | WFD1 |  |
