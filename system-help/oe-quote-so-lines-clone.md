Cloning a Line on an Order
==========================

You may clone a line on a quote/order, e.g. to order multiple lengths of the same product. You can clone fixed, cut, and random length product lines. The dimension will be copied from the source line; you cannot change the size.

1. On the Details tab of the order, select a line and click Clone.
2. For each additional line of the selected product:
   * Enter the width and/or length (depending on the dimensions of the selected product), quantity and any remarks.
   * The Selling Price defaults to Price Book but you can enter a specific price if required, or click Alt Price if you want to set a price per lb, or to calculate the price according to a desired gross margin amount or percentage, or markup percentage. If you override the default Selling Price, the F check box is selected indicated that the prize is frozen and will not be affected by other changes to the original product line.
3. Add additional lines as required.

Click Sales or Quotes to view the history of sales (or quotes) of this product to this or all customers.

4. Click Save. The new lines are added to the quote/order.
