long_description: "This document is a 'Certification of Test,' also known as a Mill Test Report (MTR), issued by Phoenix Tube Company, Inc., a manufacturer of stainless ornamental and structural tubing. It certifies the properties of a specific shipment of Grade 304 stainless steel, identified by Heat #2WH5. The report provides customer and order details, including order number 182448 and customer order number 141917. It lists a comprehensive set of specifications the material conforms to, such as ASTM A276, ASME SA276, and others. The core of the document consists of two main tables: a 'Chemical Analysis' table detailing the percentage composition of elements like Carbon (C), Manganese (MN), Chromium (CR), and Nickel (NI), and a 'Physical Analysis' table showing mechanical properties like Hardness (RB), Yield Strength (PSI), and Tensile Strength (PSI). The document also includes a statement confirming that mercury is not used in their processes and that the material has been heat-treated to prevent carbide precipitation. It concludes with a certification statement, contact information for the manufacturer, and details from the distributor, 4GL Solutions."
