| 39456 | New switch to set number of days prior to today to look for invoices | System Controls (MS33) has a new BI field to group all dashboard-related switches. The first switch is “Invoices Today Days Back”. This is the number of days to look back for the Invoices Today field in the Salesperson and Sales Manager dashboards. For example, if the switch is set to 0, then only invoices for today should be shown.  If the switch is set to 1, then only invoices for today - 1 should be shown, etc.  You may need to refresh the page after saving the switch value to see the change. | MS33 | Salesperson Dashboard Widgets |
