1. Choose General Ledger » Journal Entry » Journal Entry Remarks [GL3C].
2. Enter or select a singleJournal Number to look up.  
   or  
   Enter or select a Fiscal Period.  
   or  
   Leave both fields blank and press Tab to list all journal entries in all fiscal periods.
3. Edit any Descriptions inline as appropriate.
4. A “+” in the + column indicates existing remarks. Press F4 in the + field to view or add remarks.
