Supporting Software/Hardware
============================

Networking/VPN
--------------

Your company network will require a high speed router (ADSL, Cable) with a firewall. Additionally, the network must be protected by a VPN (Virtual Private Network) software/appliance. For a multi-site operation, we recommend an SDSL data service where the server is located.

Port forwarding must be enabled through the firewall, router and VPN to the internal IP address of the Linux server that will be hosting . SSH is used by 4GL Solutions to gain remote access to the server for future upgrades, maintenance, backup support and license administration.

External internet access to the server must be a static IP address.

Printers
--------

To be compatible with , laser printers must be PCL 6 compliant, for overlay document form printing. Printers must be connected to the network via an Ethernet port: printers attached via USB / parallel ports are not currently supported.

The HP LaserJet® M602 or HP4515 are currently recommended (although new printers are always coming on the market). Both have an option for multiple input trays and support USB input [but above says printers connected via USB are not supported?](macros can be saved to a USB drive). However, the exact printer choice may be further dictated by future technologies, anticipated report volume, number of input paper trays required, and by various location or department requirements.

For environments wanting a multi-functional printer, some customers use the Sharp “MX” series (MX-283, MX-363, MX-453, MX-503). This printer makes it easy to save macros to the hard drive and to retain them even in the event of a power failure. It also removes the costs of a separate fax machine and/or scanner.

Backups
-------

4GL Solutions is an authorized dealer for Yosemite Backup Basic Suite. We recommend backups be stored on an external NAS Drive. We also offer external backups to the cloud: in the event of a disaster we can have your site up and running within three hours (your staff would require access to the internet).

Fax Modem
---------

[see Fax/Email Printer setup (original content had a link but did not work)]

For installations that will use fax capabilities, 4GL Solutions offers  Fax – a faxing solution using the internet. We also offer EskerFax: please contact us for pricing.
