Reversing a Vendor Invoice
==========================

This function is used to reverse an existing invoice.Also seems to be a slight bit broken??? Screen is hard to read.

Voucher reversal does not require running of Voucher Proof Listing/Update - AP22. Reversal is posted automatically when processed.

1. Choose Accounts Payable » Vendor Invoice Processing » Vendor Invoice Reversal [AP21BR].
