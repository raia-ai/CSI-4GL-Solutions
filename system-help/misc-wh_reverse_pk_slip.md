Reverse Packing Slip
====================

[from old help, not on menu; purpose/why would you do this?]

Once reversed, lines on a sales order must be “reopened” in order to modify a line on the handheld. [how/where?]

![](../Resources/Images/WH_reverse_pk_slip.png)

Scan or enter the Document number of the packing slip to be reversed, then type “1” to process the reversal.

[does it return to the menu, or do you have to enter \*EXIT\*?]
