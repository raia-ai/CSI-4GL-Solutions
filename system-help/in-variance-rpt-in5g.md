Variance Report
===============

This report lists all tags that have a variance (percent, quantity or $ value) greater than the selected acceptable variance. You can run this report multiple times during the count; however, if you are using Average costing, you cannot run this report again once the physical count has been posted.

\*\* Important \*\* - Save a copy (paper & Excel) of your final variance report just prior to posting.

1. Choose Inventory Control » Physical Inventory » Variance Report [IN5G].


5. Select whether to produce a Detailed report (lists individual logs) or **S**ummary report (lists product code summary information).
6. Enter theVariance Type (Percent, Quantity, or Value) and  Acceptable Variance. The report will be filtered by value based on the type. For example, if “V” is entered in Variance Type and “1000” is entered in Acceptable Variance, the report will list all variance greater than or equal to $1,000.
7. Indicate if the report should be filtered by just the tags that have already been counted (**T**his Count) or all logs (**E**ntire) frozen at the time the physical inventory count was created.
