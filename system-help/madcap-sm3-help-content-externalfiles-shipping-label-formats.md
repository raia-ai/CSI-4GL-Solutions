long_description: "This document serves as a comprehensive reference for shipping label formats generated by the 4GL Solutions software, tailored for the metal industry. It is organized by label dimensions, presenting a variety of layouts designed to meet different logistical and customer requirements. The formats include 4x6\", 5x3\", 4x2\", 4x1\", 7.5x13cm, and a small 1.5x.5\" voucher label. Each format is assigned a unique `Label Code` (e.g., `LRSHPLB3`, `LBSHPLB6`) for easy identification and selection within the system. The sample labels display critical shipping data, such as `CUSTOMER SHIPTO` information, `PRODUCT INFORMATION` (including heat, lot, and quantity), `ORDER INFORMATION` (with order numbers and customer POs), and scannable barcodes. Variations cater to specific needs, such as including or excluding logos, displaying order line descriptions, country of origin, or detailed remarks. This guide is essential for warehouse personnel, logistics coordinators, and system administrators to understand and select the appropriate label for their shipping processes."
