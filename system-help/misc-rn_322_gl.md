| 39765 | New function to reopen a closed bank period | A new function, “Open Cash Book Period”, reopens a closed fiscal period. The B/F and C/F are reverted to the amounts before the period was closed. You can only reopen one period at a time, so if you need to reopen multiple periods you would work backwards one at a time from the most recently closed period. | CB98 |  |
