Kasto Load PO Receipts [KA35WA]
===============================

This function allows you to scan a Receipt Header plus a number of Receipt Lines. A document is created in KAH\_HDR and KAD\_DTL. When it is processed it will write out a HLAU KAR\_RCV record for each data line. These records will then be taken up by the Communication Engine.
