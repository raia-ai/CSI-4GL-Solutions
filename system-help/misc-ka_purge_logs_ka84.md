Purge Send & Receive Logs [KA84]
================================

Use this function as needed to purge send and receive log files (KA64 and KA63) that are at least a year old.

The Purge Date defaults to one year ago; you can adjust it earlier but not later. The Process button is not enabled until a valid Purge Date is selected.

When you click Process, the system will display the number of records purged.
