Schedule Production Order
=========================

[from old help, not on menu]

Schedule lines on the production order [meaning?]. When scheduled, “Y” will display on the Machine Production Confirmation [xref, PR42].

1. Scan or enter the Doc number of the work order to be scheduled.
2. Scan or enter the Line number to be scheduled.
3. Scan or enter the Machine number.

   1=Schedule  
   2=Start

[does it return to the menu, or do you have to enter \*EXIT\*?]
