Navigating
==========

* main menu, top/dropdown menu (Customer/Inventory/Vendor)
* help message/tip at the bottom of the form to provide guidance for each field
* tabs on forms
* difference between types of screens (record screens vs options screens)

Using Screen IDs
----------------

All forms and reports are assigned a screen ID that can be used as a shortcut: Once you become familiar with the screen IDs for the forms and reports you use frequently, you can just enter the screen ID in the search field to jump directly to that form:

To find the screen ID for a form or report:

* If you're already in the screen, e.g. by navigating through the menus, you can find the screen ID at the bottom of the window:

* When you are looking at menu, make note of the number of the menu item you want, then enter “??” (no quotes) in the search field. Each menu item changes to display the screen ID rather than the title. Repeat “??” to revert to the titles.
* When you are looking at the online help, the screen ID is identified at the end of the first navigation step (e.g. Choose Sales Order Entry » SO Entry/Maintenance » Sales Order Entry/Maintenance [OE31]).

Adding a Form to Your Favorites
-------------------------------

You can “bookmark” up to ten favorite menu items; this list appears on the left side of the window when viewing any menu. Favorites are specific to each login ID.

To bookmark a favorite:

1. Navigate the menus to the page with the item you want to bookmark (do not click it to open it).
2. Click Define below the Favorites list. The Favorites list turns red.
3. Click on the line in the Favorites list where you want to add the item, then click the item in the menu. You are prompted to enter a label as you want it to appear in the Favorites list. You can create any label that makes sense to you, e.g. a shortened version of the form name, or the screen ID, etc.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 to bookmark more favorites. You can define any number of
   favorites (up to 10) in any of the ten rows; they don't have to be contiguous.

There are two ways to delete a favorite:

* Repeat the steps above to override the row with a new menu item;   
  or
* Repeat steps 2-3, selecting any menu item, but enter a space when prompted for the label.

You cannot reorder the list; you would have to redefine the rows as required.

If you know the screen ID but not where to find it in the menus, enter it in the Menu Search field. In the list of matches, select the one you want and click Called From to see the menu path where you can find it.
