long_description: "This file contains the ACH Authorization Form used to begin configuration for sending Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments. To enable ACH transactions, organizations must supply specific information for each bank account to be used. The form collects the bank’s name, a primary contact and phone number, whether the institution requires a balanced ACH file, and the company’s IRS Federal Tax ID (up to 10 digits) for use as the Company ID Number. In addition to bank contact details, the form requests the routing transit (ABA) number associated with the account (maximum 9 digits), the account number (maximum 12 digits), and the account type, which should be indicated as Checking, Saving, or Depository. If multiple bank accounts will be configured, a separate copy of the form should be completed for each account, ensuring that the ACH file requirements and identifiers are captured accurately for every institution. Once all requested fields are completed, the document instructs users to submit the form to 4GL Solutions via the provided email address (info@4glsol.com). Submission of the form authorizes the setup fees quoted by 4GL Solutions. This concise form serves as the prerequisite step for ACH enablement and ensures that all critical banking parameters are collected in a consistent format to support secure and accurate ACH file generation."
