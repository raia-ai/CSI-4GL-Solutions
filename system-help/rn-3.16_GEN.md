| 37739 | Enter custom subject and body when sending email to contacts from sales orders, quotes, POs, and customer statements. | When processing an order, quote, or PO, if a contact is specified to receive an email (on the Contacts tab), you can edit the default subject and message. This also applies to generating a customer statement.  These changes apply to the particular order/quote/PO/statement only; they do not affect the system default. If necessary you can change the system default body (in MS33>System>Text Used in Body of Outgoing Emails) but you cannot change the system default subject lines used for different document types. | OE31, OE32,  PO31,  AR7F |  |
