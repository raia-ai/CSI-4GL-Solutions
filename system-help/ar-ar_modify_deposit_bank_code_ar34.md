Modifying the Deposit Bank Code
===============================

This screen is used to change a cash receipt document to a different bank account1. It can only be used if the receipt has not been posted. If the cash receipt has been posted, you must reverse the cash receipt and re-enter the deposit.

1. Choose Accounts Receivable » Entry/Maintenance » Modify Deposit Bank Code [AR34].
2. Locate the deposit that you want to change, then select the New Bank account to move the deposit to.
3. When you exit the window, you are prompted to either **P**rocess the changes, or place them on **H**old.   
   You must **P**rocess upon exiting, otherwise the changes are saved but not applied.
