Reopening a Lost Quote
======================

When a quote is marked as lost, e.g. due to unacceptable delivery date, price, etc., the quote is removed from the Quotes Follow Up screen. If the customer later decides to continue with the quote, you must reset its status before you can revise it or convert it to a sales order.

To reset the status of a lost quote:

1. Choose Sales Order Entry » SO Entry/Maintenance » Re-Open Lost Sales Quote[OE3DA].
2. You can search by Customer, PO Number, or Order Desc.

The quote is reset to Open status and can be opened from the quote entry/maintenance window [OE32].
