Setting Up the Task Manager
===========================

Task definition (TK11 and TK17) are visible to users but are editable by 4GL staff only. They contain a number of hard & soft-coded, complex, interdependent configurations that exceed the responsibilities of system administrators, support and implementation specialists. Please  for assistance configuring the other Task Manager setup functions described in this topic.

Task Type Maintenance [TK11]
----------------------------

This form contains all task types; each is assigned one or more flags that indicate how it functions. These are controlled by 4GL, but you may change the Email setting.

* Group Only - the task cannot be assigned to individual users; you must define the default group for this task type in the Diary Group field.
* Message Task - notification only, no action, e.g. your order has been approved
* System Only - System tasks are automatically generated by precursor actions. For example, a sales order that meets specific value criteria could be configured to require a credit approval task. The configured task will be generated automatically upon processing a qualifying sales order. System tasks can only be modified by 4GL.
* Email - This is the only user-editable aspect of this form. The Email setting determines whether the task should be emailed as well as displayed as a notification upon login. This setting uses the Email address entered in the System Controls [MS33] Location Details.

Tasks/Routes Relationship [TK17]
--------------------------------

This form logically links the task types to specific routes that are soft-coded paths of handling tasks. Tasks are stamped with task route, warehouse and doc number at time of generation.

This form is display only but is sortable; for example, you may choose to view all tasks related to a specific Type of Entry. [do we need to describe what each column means/controls?]

PO Approval Limit Maintenance [PO1G]
------------------------------------

This form works in conjunction with the Buyer Master [PO12]: for users marked as requiring approval in that form, this form defines the approval requirements for different values of purchase orders. For example, for up to $100 no approval is required; for $101-500 approval is required by one of the operators specified for that level; for $501-2,500 approval is required by two of the operators specified for that level, etc.

* Upper Limit - Enter the value in local currency dollars, that if exceeded will trigger a PO approval, e.g. 5000 or 10000.
* Optionally, enter a Description of the level, e.g. the value, or who can approve up to that level, such as salespeople or sales managers.
* Indicate the number of operators Required to approve this level. For example, for orders above $10,000 one approval is required (e.g. by a a sales manager); for orders above $1 million, two approvals are required, etc.
* Specify the Operators who can approve up to the selected limit.

This form includes a Warehouse field so that approval matrices can be set up per warehouse. Entries defined with no warehouse selected are considered the “master” matrix entries; these are used unless entries for a specific warehouse are entered.

Class/Task Type Maintenance [TK12]
----------------------------------

This form links a security class and task type combination to assorted permissions. Your environment may require class/task type permissions to vary by warehouse.

1. Select an entry and click Modify, or click Add to create a new entry.
2. Select the appropriate Security Class.
3. Select a Type of Entry and a Task Type.
4. All warehouses are listed. If you want to include all warehouses in this definition, select the All Warehouses check box. Otherwise, select the S check box beside each warehouse that should be included.
5. Select the appropriate permission(s) that users belonging to the specified security class can do with the selected TOE and Task Type:
   * Create tasks of this type. Leave unchecked to allow approval only. The Create permission only pertains to non-system tasks.
   * Edit tasks of this type. Leave unchecked to allow read-only.
   * Receive tasks of this type. This is only used when manually creating a new task for group recipients. The group itself will have a security class and if that security class has “Receive” permissions for this TOE and task type then you will be able to send the task to that group.
   * Peer Access - ignore the class hierarchy and allow users or groups (users in that group) in the same security class to action tasks assigned to the specific individual or group.
6. For Sales Orders and Sales Quote types of entry, as well as MTRNOTFOUND, indicate the Sales Authorization: whether individuals in this security class can action All salespersons' documents, only their own documents (Single), or everyone else's but not their own documents (All Other).

Group Maintenance [TK18]
------------------------

This form defines the groups that tasks can be assigned to. Create a group, assign a class, then add operators to the group.

1. Select a group and click Amend, or click New to create a new group. [does “Amend” have a particular meaning in distinct from “Edit” which is used everywhere else?]
2. Enter a unique Group ID and a Description that will be used to select assignees and filters.
3. Select the Security Class that can be assigned or approve tasks. This field only applies to user-type (non-system) tasks assigned to a group.
4. To assign operators to the group, select the name on the left and click Assign. To remove an operator from the group, select the name on the right and click Unassign.
5. Click Save.

Security Class Hierarchy [SECH]
-------------------------------

If you have added a new class, be sure to add tasks in TK12.

Security classes are built using a hierarchy that allows superior classes to inherit all permissions of subordinates. Tasks in  always have an owner: either a group or an individual. System tasks are always owned by a group, while non-system custom tasks can have either group or user ownership.

Select an existing security class in the Folders table (top left), then select a class from the Unassigned table (lower left) and click Assign to insert it as a subordinate class.

* **Group**: You can create a task and assign to a group only if the group has received permissions for that type. The permission algorithm is:
  + Are you part of the group?
  + If not, are you a supervisor of a person in that group?
  + If not, is your security class superior to the security class assigned to the group?
* **User**: Tasks can be assigned to a user only if they have edit permissions for that task. Upon attempting to edit the permission algorithm is:
  + Are you the assigned user with edit permission?
  + If not, are you the person's supervisor?
  + If not, does your security class grant superior permissions?

  Peer access applies to user tasks only, allowing security classes with equal permissions to complete tasks.

A user granted “Full Control” security can view and manage tasks for all users including those for a group they are not a member of.

Example Task Manager Setup
--------------------------

Let’s assume your organization chart looks like this:

![](../../Resources/Images/TM_org_chart.png)

In this hierarchy:

* Owner can approve all Task Manager activities.
* Sales Manager for Whse 10 can approve Task Manager activities for Whse 10 staff, but cannot approve Whse 20 activities.
* Sales Manager for Whse 20 can only approve Whse 20 activities.

To configure Task Manager for this hierarchy:

1. Create Security Classes (Security Menu » Security Classes) for each of the positions.
2. Assign the classes to the users (MS32).
3. Assign the class to the Task Manager tasks (Class/Task Type Maintenance [TK12]).
4. Assign user codes to the Group ID (Group Maintenance [TK18])
5. Set up your Security Class Hierarchy [SECH].   
   You must start from the top down – in our example, to add the two Sales Managers underneath the Owner, click on the Owner class and assign the two classes (Sales Mgr 10 / Sales Mgr 20) to this level.

Operator Maintenance [MS32]
---------------------------

You must configure each user's access to the Task Manager.

On the Security tab, the following fields are related to the user's access to and use of the Task Manager:

* Navigate to Tasks - If enabled, the Task Manager will open automatically upon login.
* Supervisor - The specified Supervisor can view, approve, disapprove, reassign, or edit tasks owned by the current user. For group tasks a supervisor must be a member of the corresponding group in order to perform any action on the task (e.g. credit hold, PO approval).
* Out Begin Date, Out End Date, Forward To
   - If the user will be unable to manage their tasks for a period of time (e.g. vacation, illness, etc.), you may forward their tasks to another user for the specified time period. The task is only created for that Forward To user and not the current user, but the original user's supervisor will still be able to view the user's tasks as well.
  The Forward To user must be in a security class that can access the task. When you select the Forward To user, if they are in a security class with access to the same tasks, you will be asked if you want to also forward the current operator’s existing tasks to the Forward To operator.
* Full Control - The user can manage tasks for all users, including those for a group they are not a member of.
* Security Class - This determines the permissions and tasks that will be available to the user.

Changing a user's Security Class may have implications in Group Maintenance [TK18]; review to ensure the user's group membership is accurate.

In order to approve credit/debit memos, a user must be identified as a CM/DM Manager in Options > Order Entry.
