This function is used to view information about purchase order costs vs actual amount paid variances and any write-offs for a particular purchase order receipt. Write offs can be written off at time of AP Voucher Entry.

1. Choose Accounts Payable » AP Inquiries » Accrual Inquiry [AP66].
3. Enter or select Buyer code, select check-box to have all chosen.
4. Enter or select Purchase Order number, select check-box to have all chosen.
5. Enter or select Receipt number, select check-box to have all chosen.
7. Enter or select a Vendor to filter the report.

Goes into a few menus that seem like view only. Not sure about documenting, if there is anything important to catch.
