ARC - Printing Customer Labels - 1.33x4
=======================================

This function is used to print labels based on sales activity selections.

1. Choose Accounts Receivable » AR Reports » Customer Labels - 1.33 X 4  [ARC].
3. Enter the number of Activity Days a customer must have to have labels printed for them (by default, labels are printed regardless of activity days - glossary term? ).
4. Enter or select Sales Days.
5. Enter the minimum Sales Amount (in dollars) that must have accumulated in the Activity Days a customer must have to have labels printed for them. - this wording is totally wrong
6. Leave default to Sort Alphabetically, or enter blank to not.

Output generates Labels - cant generate output
