Viewing Changes to a Document
=============================

tracks status changes for the following documents:

* Quotes
* Sales Orders
* Invoices
* Purchase Orders
* Outside Processing Orders
* Inside Processing Orders

To view the history of changes to a document, click Tracking. The Document Tracking screen serves as a system audit, i.e. what changes were made to this record and by whom.

Each status code displayed is one of the following Types:

* SYS are system status codes that are assigned automatically at different stages, such as ASG when a sales order is first entered, then PCK when the order goes to picking confirmation, etc.
* USR are user-defined status codes. These are never written to a document automatically from , but are applied to a document in MS3V or WF1D.
