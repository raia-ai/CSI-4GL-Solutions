About In-house Production
=========================

links an in-house production process directly to the sales entry process. This ensures that when a sales order is processed, required processing is scheduled and costed accordingly, allowing the salesperson to provide the customer with accurate pricing (sales & costs) and delivery dates.

However, in-house processing does not have to be linked to a sales order – production orders can be created and scheduled with resulting finished pieces correctly costed and put back in inventory.

In order to optimize inventory,  provides linear nesting of long products, and plate nesting integrated with SigmaNEST.

When a line in a sales order references a machine code that is defined (in PR11) as an Inside process, when the SO is processed an FG will be created and the set allocation screen presented before the IP document is created. [Ref 38874>3.18 - Testing\_notes\_Aug 8.xlsx]
