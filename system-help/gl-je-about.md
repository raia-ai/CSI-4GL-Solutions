About Journal Entries
=====================

There are three options to create journal entries (JE) in :

* regular (one-time) journal entries
* recurring journal entries
* Excel import

Once processed, journal entries must be posted to the general ledger.

A journal entry can be aborted if it has not yet been posted; posted entries can be reversed.

View journal entries in the Inquiry screens or in the Journal Entry Report.
