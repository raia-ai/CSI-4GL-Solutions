short_description: "This document defines the Purchasing Tariff Procedure and provides a structured, step-by-step guide for how tariffs, duties, and related procurement charges are requested, validated, approved, and applied. It clarifies scope, roles and responsibilities, inputs and outputs, and the timing of actions so that purchase orders, contracts, and invoices reflect accurate landed costs. The procedure also summarizes document controls, evidence requirements, and review cadences that support internal policy and regulatory compliance. Where applicable, it points to supporting forms, master data elements, and systems used to calculate or reference tariff rates, and describes how exceptions or disputes are escalated and resolved to maintain continuity of supply and accurate financial recognition."
long_description: "The Purchasing Tariff Procedure establishes a consistent, end‑to‑end method for managing tariffs, duties, surcharges, and similar cost elements across the procurement lifecycle. It defines scope and applicability; key terms and references; roles and responsibilities for Purchasing, Finance, Logistics, Compliance, and other stakeholders; and the specific triggers that require tariff creation, update, review, or removal. The process flow outlines how tariff requirements are identified (for example, from vendor quotations, customs schedules, trade agreements, or regulatory notices), how supporting evidence is compiled, and how requests are prepared with sufficient detail for review. Approval logic and thresholds are described so that changes are authorized by the appropriate level of management, with clear segregation of duties and auditable records. Operational steps specify where in the process tariff rates are validated and applied to purchase orders, contracts, and invoices, including timing rules and required master data updates to ensure that landed costs are calculated accurately and consistently. Interfaces to adjacent processes are mapped, including touchpoints with Accounts Payable (for invoice validation), Inventory and Cost Accounting (for capitalization and expense treatment), and Logistics (for import/export and freight coordination). The procedure highlights sources of data truth, the expected format of documentation, and minimum retention requirements, and it includes guidance for handling exceptions, disputes, and retroactive corrections in a controlled manner. Periodic governance activities—such as rate reviews, variance analysis, spot checks, and monitoring of regulatory or trade changes—are defined to reduce risk and maintain compliance. Responsibilities for reporting and key performance indicators are suggested to help stakeholders track timeliness, accuracy, and financial impact. Collectively, these elements enable teams to execute purchasing activities with transparent cost build‑ups, reliable approvals, and strong audit trails while maintaining continuity of supply and adherence to internal policy and external tariff regulations. The document also delineates master data ownership and change‑control procedures for tariff codes, commodity classifications, and vendor‑specific rate agreements, including how effective dates and expirations are managed to prevent misapplication. It references common system roles and access considerations so that users who request, enter, and approve tariff rates have appropriate entitlements, with changes logged for traceability. Standard forms and templates are identified for initiating requests, capturing approvals, and storing evidence; naming conventions and filing locations are specified to support efficient retrieval. Training and communication expectations are outlined to ensure that process participants understand their responsibilities and stay current on regulatory updates, trade agreements, and internal policy changes. The procedure suggests practical controls testing routines—such as sample reviews of recent updates, tie‑outs to official sources, and reconciliation of invoice charges to approved rates—to continuously validate accuracy. Common risk scenarios (e.g., missing documentation, outdated rates, incorrect commodity classification, duplicate or overlapping entries, and system configuration gaps) are described with recommended mitigations and escalation paths. Finally, the document summarizes record retention requirements and audit readiness practices, offering checklists that help teams demonstrate compliance quickly during internal or external reviews while minimizing disruption to daily operations."

## Overview

**Tariff Procedure**
This documentoutlines theconfigurations required to apply a 25% tariff tomaterial that is purchased fromAmerican vendors. This 25% charge would bepulled through to the cost of the material at the receiving stagehence, affecting the sales order and effectively passing on the25% to the customer.

Setup
Toget thisconfigured, aTAR (tariff) purchase costmustbe created. This cost would then need beapplied to a purchase shipping term.Once this has been completed, the vendor issetup to use that shipping term. Additionally, a new vendor account type must be created.
1. Navigate to Purchasing > File Maintenance > Purchase Costs
  1. In this window, create the TAR cost and set the "Type" to "HDR", put an "A" in the "1" column andenter "LOT" as the "PUM".
  1. Click thethree dots on the "GL" column and enter the appropriate values. The "Actual GL" can be left as9999-00; however, it is advised to use an appropriate GL code for the "Accrual GL"

1. InPurchasing > File Maintenance > PurchaseShipping Terms
  1. Add the TAR purchase cost to the appropriate shipping term that would be applied to the vendor in PO11. In this screen, you are also able toconfigure the currency of the cost and check off the "Ovr" box to allowusers to override the cost description

1. Create a new vendor account type in Accounts Payable > File Maintenance > Vendor Account Types. In this example, I have created "AI" for "American Inventory". Checkoff the "Inv" box and setup the GL as desired.

1. Finallyconfigure the desired vendor in the Vendor Master file (PO11)to anAmerican Inventory Account type and to use the purchase shipping term that has the TAR cost applied to it.

1. Once everything has been configured, you can enter a PO as you would normally do. The only change would be manually calculating the 25% tariff and adding it to theto the PO using the "Shipping Costs" button.
